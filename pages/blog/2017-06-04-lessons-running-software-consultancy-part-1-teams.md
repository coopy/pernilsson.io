This is the first in a series of posts where I sum up my thoughts and opinions based on my experience from four years at a software consultancy.

While I'm not a founding partner, I was the first manager hired, and my responsibilities have ranged from _leading teams, individual contribution, project management, hiring, internal process development, business strategy, client negotiations,_ to, in the last two years, running **all business operations** together with a small core leadership team.

## Part 1: Put the right team together

When putting a team together for a project, no matter how short, always appoint a **technically strong person** as a lead.

Even if a customer has their own engineering organization and tech lead, to produce quality work, you need a person with the right experience to coach the customer and team to make the right decisions.

Encourage your team to gently disagree with the customer when they think the project isn't going in the right direction. **Empower your leads** to make technical decisions on their own, only bringing something to you when the project itself may change.

If you don't do this, you're going to end up spending more time managing the project than you can afford. You'll be in fire-fighting mode (dealing with the consequences of bad decisions), or tech lead mode (supporting your team and arguing for simpler solutions). This is not your job.

Your job is to make sure the team has fulfilling work and a good work environment, and that the customer are happy with the results and the talented team provided.
